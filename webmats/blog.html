                <summary>8/29/2024, Finance Software Project: How I got the data, organized it, issues I found and solved, creation of the Mega table.</summary>
                <p>The SEC allows queries to be requested from their EDGAR API. Using Python scripting, I was able to gather full SEC filings for any company of my choosing, afte gathering 
                    a document from them that matched company tickers to the value they assign to the company for their record keeping, a 'CIK' number. Automating the process to cycle through 
                    CIK values, query EDGAR, and record the responses to CSV's was the first iteration of data collection. Those CSV's could then be parsed at my discretion. Obviously, only a handful 
                    were first gathered.
                </p>
                <p>Each value reported the SEC uses some familiar names, some alien to those not versed deeply in accounting, XBRL, or SEC-speak. Some values had to be found and matched to determine exactly 
                    which data represented which values for companies. To this day, some values are still missing. First, I found numerical values from SeekingAlpha.com or StockAnalysis.com, and then 
                    did a simple 'CTRL+F' in the CSV's to try and find how those values were labeled. In most cases, finding those matching numbers illuminated how the accounting values are stored, logged, 
                    reported to the SEC. In some cases, the values had to be broken into pieces and later added together, such as long term and short term debt to equal total debt values. In rare cases, 
                    values weren't, or haven't yet been, found. This is evident on the website in that some Financial sector stocks have zero revenue data. Obviously, they have revenue data, but my site and 
                    database don't reflect that because I couldn't find either the annual amount in total, nor in parts, nor under any labeling of the SEC CSV's, stumping me temporarily until a later date.
                </p>
                <p>The Python scripts were then added to, to gather the relevant values, and to coalesce them into a dataframe. Missing values were cleaned via back-and-forward fill, average-value-filling, or 
                    left blank, whichever was most appropriate for the data type. Some values were also calculated from this data, such as ROCE from Net Income and Shareholder's Equity. Growth rates were also 
                    calculated for each year's interval. After a completely filling a dataframe with all relevant financial data, all calculated data, that dataframe was uploaded to a matching DB table, entitled 
                    Mega which was made via models.py in Django, and a new CIK query was sent to SEC's EDGAR to fetch the next ticker's data.
                </p>
                <p>One issue found after the first update to the Mega table, was a new earliest year of data, possibly missed on earlier rounds of data wrangling, that backfilling cleaning functions 
                    have inaccurately filled missing values with the LATEST years' financial data. For example, revenue values for TSLA in 2007 are matching revenue values in 2023. Oops! This will be remedied 
                    with a simple comparison function, drawing SQL statements from Mega, and if the first years' data matches the final years' data, then we'll just drop the first years' data, or wipe it clean. 
                    That's how I'm thinking of fixing this particular issue, but I will update here as we proceed to clean up such bugs. Otherwise, all data therein appears to match cross references with the aforementioned 
                    websites' data, giving me confidence that our data collection methods are working well 'enough' for most retail investors to get at least a marginal use out of our databanks. Educational use only, 
                    of course.

                <summary>9/6/2024, Finance Software Project: What's involved in the creation of the Metadata table.</summary>
                <p>From the Mega table, we can calculate averages of all values. Taking the list of Mega values, we have two averages calculated, average and average ignoring zeroes. Most of what you 
                    see is the former, the latter was mostly used to determine if stock splits and faulty data recording were showing obtuse values.
                </p>
                <p>Averages for all values are calculated. Metadata is essentially a single row for each ticker in the table. It generates a tangible set of data for users to digest the information 
                    that each security registers or reports to the SEC.
                </p>
                <p>One nifty trick was the cleaning and then display of any data in the Mega table was to exclude any outliers in the data column being analyzed. In each report, stock splits make 
                    the data present in ridiculous ways. Luckily, using statistical methods allows for the ignorance of such values via Interquartile ranges, projecting averages from values that aren't 
                    outliers, that also matched fairly closely to value on other sites. 
                </p>
                <p>Metadata fuels the stock ranking pages of our site. Raw values, revenue of a specific year, means almost nothing. But the average revenue growth over the lifetime of reports gathered? 
                    That is something useful that people can use to make wise investment decisions. After contacting a financial advisor, of course.
                </p>

                <summary>9/6/2024, Finance Software Project: What even are the Stock Rankings?</summary>
                <p>Evaluating values in the Metadata table, we can rank stocks in each sector. Each sector requires different evaluation metrics, and our rankings try to capture the best of the 
                    best in each sector, based on those metrics.
                </p>
                <p>Each value in Metadata is given a ranking, and each value is also given a score. So dividend growth, for example, has a score between '-5' an '5', then the weighting is multiplied by that 
                    score, allowing us to weight each stock in comparison to all the others in that sector.
                </p>
                <p>These weightings will change over time, but the Sector Rankings will remain available to stock pickers via our site because that's part of what we offer to those who are interested. 
                    Energy stocks need to be compared to other energy stocks. Given our weighting schema, how do each of the firms in each sector compare to each other? It could be a useful tool to 
                    investors to help decide where to allocate their money. After contacting a finanical advisor, of course. Never take our recommendations at face value, only. None of our site's 
                    productions should be construed as financial advice.
                </p>
                <p>As the rankings change through the years, we'll keep users informed of changes in the rankings, and how the rankings are constructed. Expect more posts explaining exactly how 
                    we do our ranking of each sector: It's subjective, but we hope to provide an overview of each sector such that users of the site are able to evaluate and weigh important investing 
                    decisions for themselves.
