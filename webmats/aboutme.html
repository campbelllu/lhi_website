            </p>

        	<p>
                Luke is a happily married father of two. A tenacious autodidact, a curious tinkerer, he spends his free time building out software projects and writing. 
                Every day provides a new adventure, and with the right attitude the challenges always transform into a blessing.
        	</p>
            <p>
                Hobbies include: Climbing trees with the kids, pretending to be a savant investor before just buying ETF's anyway, going on long rants, 
                and mispronouncing the word 'grotesque' as 'grow-tess-Q' because that's how he first said it in his head while reading it.
            </p>
            <p>
                He has written books, and blog postings for himself and clients over the past decade. His Youtube channel is growing slowly and steadily. He is, at this time, 72 days free 
                of accidental spillings of water on his shirt while taking a drink. 
            </p>
            <p>
                He wants you to know that you are capable, powerful, loved, and that you matter. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Check the links up top and have a wonderful day!
